# VCluster


Virtual clusters are Kubernetes clusters that run on top of other Kubernetes clusters. Compared to fully separate "real" clusters, virtual clusters do not have their own node pools or networking. Instead, they are scheduling workloads inside the underlying cluster while having their own control plane.
